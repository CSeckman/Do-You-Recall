# **Do You Recall?**


## **Getting Started:**

In this game, the user will test their ability to recall a series of numbers! 

Three levels of difficulty are available: Beginner - 5 Numbers, Intermediate - 7 Numbers, Expert - 10 Numbers

My favorite feature is the Modal/Pop-up! This was my stretch goal and it took my game to another level. It also challenged me to refactor my code in order to work, which gave me a cleaner finished code and game. 

I hope you enjoy, play [**here**](https://do-you-recall.surge.sh/)!
